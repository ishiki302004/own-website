	    <p class="des">
		A powerful demon fox lived many years ago in the hidden village of Konoha. A tsunami occurred when it swung one of its nine tails. In exchange for his own life, the fourth hokage trapped this demon fox inside a boy. Naruto was that boy, and he grew up without a family, and the locals despised him, believing he was the demon fox himself. Naruto's ambition is to become Hokage and have the villagers recognize him.

		<h2 class="name">2. Attack on Titan</h2><br>
		<img src="../src/attack.jpeg" class="img"><br>
	    <p class="des">
		Titans, massive beasts, have nearly wiped out humanity. Titans are often many stories tall, appear to have no intelligence, consume humans, and, worst of all, appear to do so for enjoyment rather than hunger. A small percentage of humanity was able to live by walling themselves in a land protected by extraordinarily high walls, even taller than the tallest of giants. In the modern day, humanity has not seen a titan in over a century. Eren, 10, and his childhood companion Mikasa see something awful one day when the city walls are shattered by a giant titan who emerges out of nowhere. The two children watch in horror as Eren's mother is eaten alive while the smaller titans overrun the city. Eren swears to kill every titan and exact vengeance on all of humanity.

		<h2 class="name">3. Haikyuu</h2><br>
		<img src="../src/haikyuu.jpeg" class="img"><br>
	    <p class="des">
		Hinata Shouyou, a short middle school student, developed an unexpected passion for volleyball after watching a national championship match on television. Shouyou joined his school's volleyball team to emulate the championship's standout player, a short lad nicknamed "the small giant." Unfortunately, he was the only member, and the group lacked even a practice space. He didn't let that stop him, and after finally acquiring 5 other players in his final year, he was able to compete in an actual competition - only to face the championship favorite and its star player, Kageyama Tobio, dubbed "the king of the court," in the first round. Despite his team's catastrophic setback, Shouyou swears to improve and someday overcome Kageyama. Shouyou is now in his freshman year of high school, the same one he originally saw at the national finals. He's going to join the volleyball team, practice continuously, and annihilate Kageyama on the court the next time they meet. ...or so Shouyou thought, until he realized he and Kageyama were now attending the same school. Their skills are obviously needed by the volleyball team, but only if they can quit bickering and learn to work together as teammates.

		<h2 class="name">4. Blue Lock</h2><br>
		<img src="../src/bluelock.jpeg" class="img"><br>
	    <p class="des">
		Japan consistently loses the World Cup. After Isagi Yoichi, a high school forward, is eliminated in the final game of the national qualifier, he is invited to a program called "Blue Lock." Their coach will be Ego Jinpachi, who intends to "destroy Japanese loser football" by introducing a radical new training regimen: isolate 300 young forwards in a prison-like institution called "Blue Lock" and subject them to rigorous training aimed at creating "the world's greatest egotist striker."

		<h2 class="name">5. Demon Slayer</h2><br>
		<img src="../src/demonslayer.jpeg" class="img"><br>
	    <p class="des">
	    A family is invaded by demons, and only Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko escape, who is slowly turning into a demon. Tanjiro decides to become a demon slayer in order to avenge his family and heal his sister.
